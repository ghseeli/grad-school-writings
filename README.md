# Grad School Writings

This is a GitHub repository for me to keep documents I am working on in a public version control system. In this repository, I will keep

1. Class notes I have typed up. This way, my peers are able to benefit from whatever I may have put together.
1. Monographs I write. I write many of these to help me clarify points of confusion I may have about a topic. Then, later, if I need a refresher, these monographs help me remember what I had once learned, but the explanations are in my own words.

There are many advantages to making these things public.

1. Others may benefit from my work.
1. Others might catch mathematical errors I make. (If you see one, please let me know!)
1. Version control allows me to save everything and see how thoughts evolve over time.
1. A deployment system can compile my work into PDFs, so that when I make a change, the new PDFs are immediately and publically deployed.
